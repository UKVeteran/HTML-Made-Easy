<h1>The Statue of Liberty</h1>

<p>The Statue of Liberty was built over nine years by French sculptor Auguste Bartholdi.<br>Upon its completion in 1884 all 350 individual pieces of the statue were packed into 214 crates for the long boat ride from France to New York.</p>

<hr> 

<p>The statue arrived in the America several months later and was reconstructed on Liberty Island. Auguste Bartholdi thought that the New York harbor was the perfect setting for his masterpiece because it was where immigrants got their first view of the New World.</p>
